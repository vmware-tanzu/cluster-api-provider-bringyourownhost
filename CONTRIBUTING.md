# Contributing Guidelines

## As a Contributor
### Fork and branch
Local development has to be done in the forked repo of [cluster-api-provider-bringyourownhost](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/cluster-api-provider-bringyourownhost). Here are some examples of meaningful branch names
* add-host-reservation-logic
* update-readme
* fix-byomachine-controller-flakes
* refactor-agent-unit-tests

### Writing tests
We expect our contributors to write unit / integration tests when making any code change. For tests like e2e, feel free to create a child issue and work on it separately.

#### Testing Framework
- We use [Ginkgo](https://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/) and [Gomega](https://onsi.github.io/gomega/) extensively for testing (unit / integration and e2e)
- For mocking interfaces and methods, we use the [Counterfeiter](https://github.com/maxbrunsfeld/counterfeiter) tool. Use this to generate fake implementations for your unit tests.

### Commit Message
If you are pairing on a PR, make sure to use [git-duet](https://github.com/git-duet/git-duet)

To learn more about how to write a good commit message, refer to this article - [How to write a Git commit message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)

At the minimum,
* the first line of the message should be concise and clear on the intent (this becomes the title of your PR)
* write (at least) another couple of lines explaining why the commit is necessary or what is the reasoning behind certain code logic

### Raising a PR
* all PRs should be raised against the main branch of [cluster-api-provider-bringyourownhost](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/cluster-api-provider-bringyourownhost)
* all code changes should be accompanied with corresponding unit / integration tests (if for some reason, the code is not unit / integration testable, add enough justification in the PR. Although, this almost should never be the case.)
* all the commits made in the PR should be squashed into one single commit before the final merge by the PR author themselves such that it would be easier to track the commits in Git history.

### Contributor License Agreement
All contributors to this project must have a signed Contributor License
Agreement (**"CLA"**) on file with us. The CLA grants us the permissions we
need to use and redistribute your contributions as part of the project; you or
your employer retain the copyright to your contribution. Before a PR can pass
all required checks, our CLA action will prompt you to accept the agreement.
Head over to [https://cla.vmware.com/](https://cla.vmware.com/) to see your
current agreement(s) on file or to sign a new one.

We generally only need you (or your employer) to sign our CLA once and once
signed, you should be able to submit contributions to any VMware project.

Note: if you would like to submit an "_obvious fix_" for something like a typo,
formatting issue or spelling mistake, you may not need to sign the CLA.

## As a Code Reviewer
We encourage code reviews by non-maintainers as well. If you are lacking context, please ask the author to better explain the change in the description.

Look for things like
* Is the code well-designed? Is it consistent with Cluster API contract?
* Are there ways to write simpler code? If so, please suggest.
* Is the code well covered by unit / integration / e2e tests?
* Does the naming convention (variables / functions / types / methods) make sense?
* Are there enough comments? Note that comments should explain why rather than what.
