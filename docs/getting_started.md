# Getting Started

This is a guide on how to get started with Cluster API Provider BringYourOwnHost(BYOH). To learn more about Cluster API in more depth, check out the [Cluster API book][cluster-api-book].

## Install Requirements
- clusterctl, which can be downloaded from the latest [release][releases] of Cluster API (CAPI) on GitHub.
- [Kind][kind] can be used  to provide an initial management cluster for testing.
- [kubectl][kubectl] is required to access your workload clusters.
- Ubuntu 20.04 and above (Linux Kernel 5.4 and above) is required for accessing kernel configs during kubeadm preflight checks.

## Create a management cluster
Cluster API requires an existing Kubernetes cluster accessible via kubectl. During the installation process the
Kubernetes cluster will be transformed into a [management cluster](https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io/reference/glossary.html#management-cluster) by installing the Cluster API [provider components](https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io/reference/glossary.html#provider-components), so it is recommended to keep it separated from any application workload.

**Choose one of the options below:**

1. **Existing Management Cluster**

    For production use-cases a "real" Kubernetes cluster should be used with appropriate backup and DR policies and procedures in place. The Kubernetes cluster must be at least greater than v1.22.x.

    ```bash
    export KUBECONFIG=<...>
    ```
**OR**

2. **Kind**

    If you are testing locally, you can use [Kind][kind] to create a cluster with the following command:

    ```shell
    kind create cluster
    ```

---
[kind] is not designed for production use.

**Minimum [kind] supported version**: v0.9.0

Note for macOS users: you may need to [increase the memory available](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/#resources) for containers (recommend 6Gb for CAPD).

---

## Initialize the management cluster and install the BringYourOwnHost provider

Now that we've got clusterctl installed and all the prerequisites in place, let's transform the Kubernetes cluster
into a management cluster by using `clusterctl init`.

```shell
clusterctl init --infrastructure byoh
```
Note: By default, CSRs generated by BYOH host agents are automatically approved during registration. If we want to disable automatic approval, then set variable `MANUAL_CSR_APPROVAL: "enable"` in clusterctl config file. Reference for setting variables in clusterctl can be found [here](https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io/clusterctl/configuration.html#variables).

## Creating a BYOH workload cluster
 
Once the management cluster is ready, you will need to create a few hosts that the `BringYourOwnHost` provider can use, before you can create your first workload cluster.

If you already have hosts (these could be bare metal servers / VMs / containers) ready, then please skip to [Register BYOH host to management cluster](#register-byoh-host-to-management-cluster)

If not, you could create containers to deploy your workload clusters on. We have a `make` task that will create a docker image for you locally to start. 

```shell
cd cluster-api-provider-bringyourownhost
make prepare-byoh-docker-host-image
```

If you are using dev environment, you could use below target that creates docker image with all k8s components installed.

```shell
cd cluster-api-provider-bringyourownhost
make prepare-byoh-docker-host-image-dev
```

Once the image is ready, lets start 2 docker containers for our deployment. One for the control plane, and one for the worker. (you could of course run more)

```shell
for i in {1..2}
do
  echo "Creating docker container named host$i"
  docker run --detach --tty --hostname host$i --name host$i --privileged --security-opt seccomp=unconfined --tmpfs /tmp --tmpfs /run --volume /var --volume /lib/modules:/lib/modules:ro --network kind byoh/node:e2e
done
```

## Register BYOH host to management cluster


### Generating the Bootstrap Kubeconfig file
Get the APIServer and Certificate Authority Data info

```shell
APISERVER=$(kubectl config view -ojsonpath='{.clusters[0].cluster.server}')
CA_CERT=$(kubectl config view --flatten -ojsonpath='{.clusters[0].cluster.certificate-authority-data}')
```

Create a BootstrapKubeconfig CR as follows
```shell
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: infrastructure.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: BootstrapKubeconfig
metadata:
  name: bootstrap-kubeconfig
  namespace: default
spec:
  apiserver: "$APISERVER"
  certificate-authority-data: "$CA_CERT"
EOF
```

Once the BootstrapKubeconfig CR is created, fetch the object to copy the bootstrap kubeconfig file details from the Status field
```shell
kubectl get bootstrapkubeconfig bootstrap-kubeconfig -n default -o=jsonpath='{.status.bootstrapKubeconfigData}' > ~/bootstrap-kubeconfig.conf
```

We need one bootstrap-kubeconfig per host. Create as many bootstrap-kubeconfig files as there are number of hosts (2 for this guide)

---
### VM Prerequisites
- The following packages must be pre-installed on the VMs
  - socat
  - ebtables
  - ethtool
  - conntrack
- You can install these with
``` shell
sudo apt-get install socat ebtables ethtool conntrack
```
- The output of `hostname` should be added to `/etc/hosts`

Example:
```shell
$ hostname
node01

$ cat /etc/hosts
127.0.0.1 localhost
127.0.0.1 node01
...
```

If you are trying this on your own hosts, then for each host
1. Download the [byoh-hostagent-linux-amd64](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/cluster-api-provider-bringyourownhost/releases/download/v0.3.0/byoh-hostagent-linux-amd64)
2. Copy the bootstrap-kubeconfig file as `bootstrap-kubeconfig.conf`
3. Start the agent 
```shell
./byoh-hostagent-linux-amd64 --bootstrap-kubeconfig bootstrap-kubeconfig.conf > byoh-agent.log 2>&1 &
```

---
If you are trying this using the docker containers we started above, then we would first need to prep the kubeconfig to be used from the docker containers. By default, the kubeconfig states that the server is at `127.0.0.1`. We need to swap this out with the kind container IP. 

```shell
export KIND_IP=$(docker inspect -f '{{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' kind-control-plane)
sed -i 's/    server\:.*/    server\: https\:\/\/'"$KIND_IP"'\:6443/g' ~/bootstrap-kubeconfig.conf
```
Assuming you have downloaded the `byoh-hostagent-linux-amd64` into your working directory, you can use the following script to start the agent on the containers.

```shell
for i in {1..2}
do
echo "Copy agent binary to host $i"
docker cp byoh-hostagent-linux-amd64 host$i:/byoh-hostagent
echo "Copy kubeconfig to host $i"
docker cp ~/bootstrap-kubeconfig.conf host$i:/bootstrap-kubeconfig.conf
done
```

Start host agent on each of the hosts from root user and keep it running. 

>**IMPORTANT NOTE**: Use the `--skip-installation` flag if using target `make prepare-byoh-docker-host-image-dev` as we already have k8s components included in this docker image. This flag will skip k8s installation attempt on the host. The `--skip-installation` flag should not be used with target `make prepare-byoh-docker-host-image` as it's docker image doesn't come with k8s components installed.

```shell
export HOST_NAME=host1
docker exec -it $HOST_NAME sh -c "chmod +x byoh-hostagent && ./byoh-hostagent --bootstrap-kubeconfig bootstrap-kubeconfig.conf"

# do the same for host2 in a separate tab
export HOST_NAME=host2
docker exec -it $HOST_NAME sh -c "chmod +x byoh-hostagent && ./byoh-hostagent --bootstrap-kubeconfig bootstrap-kubeconfig.conf"
```
---

You should be able to view your registered hosts using

```shell
kubectl get byohosts
```

## Create workload cluster
Running the following command(on the host where you execute `clusterctl` in previous steps)

**NOTE:** The `CONTROL_PLANE_ENDPOINT_IP` is an IP that must be an IP on the same subnet as the control plane machines, it should be also an IP that is not part of your DHCP range.

If you are using docker containers then you can find the control plane machine's network subnet by running

```shell
docker network inspect kind | jq -r 'map(.IPAM.Config[].Subnet) []'
```
Randomly assign any free IP within the network subnet to the `CONTROL_PLANE_ENDPOINT_IP`. The list of IP addresses currently in use can be found by

```shell
docker network inspect kind | jq -r 'map(.Containers[].IPv4Address) []'
```

### Create the workload cluster
Generate the cluster.yaml for workload cluster
 - for vms as byohosts
    ```shell
    CONTROL_PLANE_ENDPOINT_IP=10.10.10.10 clusterctl generate cluster byoh-cluster \
      --infrastructure byoh \
      --kubernetes-version v1.25.11 \
      --control-plane-machine-count 1 \
      --worker-machine-count 1 > cluster.yaml
    ```

 - for docker hosts use the --flavor argument
    ```shell
    CONTROL_PLANE_ENDPOINT_IP=10.10.10.10 clusterctl generate cluster byoh-cluster \
        --infrastructure byoh \
        --kubernetes-version v1.25.11 \
        --control-plane-machine-count 1 \
        --worker-machine-count 1 \
        --flavor docker > cluster.yaml
    ```

Inspect and make any changes
```shell
vi cluster.yaml
```

Create the workload cluster in the current namespace on the management cluster
```shell
kubectl apply -f cluster.yaml
```

## Accessing the workload cluster

The `kubeconfig` for the workload cluster will be stored in a secret, which can
be retrieved using:

``` shell
kubectl get secret/byoh-cluster-kubeconfig -o json \
  | jq -r .data.value \
  | base64 --decode \
  > ./byoh-cluster.kubeconfig
```

The kubeconfig can then be used to apply a CNI for networking, for example, Calico:

```shell
KUBECONFIG=byoh-cluster.kubeconfig kubectl apply -f https://docs.projectcalico.org/v3.20/manifests/calico.yaml
```

after that you should see your nodes turn into ready:

```shell
$ KUBECONFIG=byoh-cluster.kubeconfig kubectl get nodes
NAME                                                          STATUS     ROLES    AGE   VERSION
byoh-cluster-8siai8                                           Ready      master   5m   v1.25.11
```

## Additional: Running host-agent as a systemd service
You can use the script `hack/install-host-agent-service.sh` to start the agent as a systemd service that restarts the agent whenever the kubeconfig changes. This can be very helpful when there are certain changes done in the kubeconfig, like certificate renewal or rotation, which takes effect after restarting the manager and that can lead to termination of the process. This script allows the host agent service to be restarted after process termination, and a watcher service observes the kubeconfig for changes. After the change is done and detected by the watcher, the agent service is restarted. This script requires superuser privillages for its execution.

```shell
./install-host-agent-service.sh path/to/agent/binary
```
**Note** : Ensure to properly shutdown processes, release ports, etc on each byoh agent re-run (i.e. pkill  byoh-agent processes, etc)
