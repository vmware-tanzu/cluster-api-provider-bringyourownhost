## What is Cluster API Provider BYOH

[Cluster API](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api) brings
declarative, Kubernetes-style APIs to cluster creation, configuration and
management.

__BYOH__ is a Cluster API Infrastructure Provider for already-provisioned hosts running Linux. This provider allows operators to adopt Cluster API for deploying and managing kubernetes nodes without also having to adopt a specific infrastructure service. This enables users to decouple kubernetes node provisioning from host and infrastructure provisioning.

## BYOH Glossary
**Host** - A host is a running computer system. It could be physical or virtual. It has a kernel and some base operating system

**BYO Host** - A Linux host provisioned and managed outside of Cluster API

**BYOH Capacity Pool** - A set of BYO Hosts registered in a management cluster & authorized for usage as a capacity for deploying Kubernetes nodes

**Kubernetes Node** - A Kubernetes Node that runs on top of a Host. There is a 1-to-1 relationship between nodes and hosts (every host has zero or one nodes). Node provisioning and lifecycle management is a Cluster API responsibility

**Kubernetes Host Components** - The components that run uncontainerized on the host and are required to bootstrap a Kubernetes node. Typically, this is at least kubelet, containerd and kubeadm, but different OS might require different components in this category

## Features

- Native Kubernetes manifests and API
- Support for single and multi-node control plane clusters
- Support already provisioned Linux VMs with Ubuntu 20.04

## Getting Started
Check out the [getting_started](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/cluster-api-provider-bringyourownhost/blob/main/docs/getting_started.md) guide for launching a BYOH workload cluster

## Project Status

This project is currently a work-in-progress, in an Alpha state, so it may not be production ready. There is no backwards-compatibility guarantee at this point. For more details on the roadmap and upcoming features, check out the project's [issue](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/cluster-api-provider-bringyourownhost/issues) tracker on GitHub.


## Getting involved and contributing

### Launching a Kubernetes cluster using BYOH source code

Check out the [developer guide](./docs/local_dev.md) for launching a BYOH cluster consisting of Docker containers as hosts.

More about development and contributing practices can be found in [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Implement Custom Installer controller
An installer controller is responsible to provide the installation and uninstallation scripts for k8s dependencies, prerequisites and components on each `BYOHost`.  
If someone wants to implement their own installer controller then they need to follow the contract defined in [installer](./docs/installer.md) doc.

## Compatibility with Cluster API

- BYOH is currently compatible wth Cluster API v1beta1 (v1.0)

## Supported OS and Kubernetes versions
| Operating System  | Architecture  | Kubernetes v1.22.* | Kubernetes v1.23.* | Kubernetes v1.24.* | Kubernetes v1.25.* |
| ------------------|---------------|:------------------:|:------------------:|:------------------:|:------------------:|
| Ubuntu 20.04.*    | amd64         |         ✓          |         ✓          |         ✓          |         ✓          |

**NOTE:**  The '*' in OS means that all Ubuntu 20.04 patches are supported.

**NOTE:**  The '*' in the K8s version means that the K8s minor release is supported but it may happen that a BYOH bundle for a specific patch may not exist in the OCI registry.
