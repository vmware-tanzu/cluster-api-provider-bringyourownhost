If you are using BYOH and would like to be included in the list of `BYOH Adopters`, add an SVG version of your logo to the `static/img/adopters` directory in this repo and submit a [pull request](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/cluster-api-provider-bringyourownhost/pulls) with your change. Name the image file something that reflects your company (e.g., if your company is called Acme, name the image acme.png).
